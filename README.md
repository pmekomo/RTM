## Generating the Makefile (CMake)

The top-level `Makefile` is generated by CMake. To create a Makefile at the repository root:

```bash
cmake -S src -B . -G "Unix Makefiles"
make
```

Recommended (preferred): do an out-of-source build in a `build/` directory:

```bash
cmake -S src -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "Unix Makefiles"
cmake --build build -- -j $(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
```

Common CMake-generated files you should ignore in VCS (add these to `.gitignore`):

```
Makefile
CMakeFiles/
CMakeCache.txt
cmake_install.cmake
build/
```

To configure interactively:

```bash
ccmake src   # or use cmake-gui
```
